BatchURLGenerator
=================

This is a small tool I built years ago to help speed the delivery of Flash banners. This tool selects files in a directory and prepends a URL to the path to each specific file and outputs the links in a textfield ready to be copied to the clipboard. This will be handy if you modify a bunch of files that need to be previewed individually from links online.
